# Python-information-stealing-program

NOT !!!

-> Requesting user information on line 60 (Gmail information)
If the victim is smart and curious, he will see your gmail information.
You go hunting on the hunt :)
So you can convert the py file to exe

What does the program do :

  -It may seem like an innocent calculator at first, but while the calculator is running, it sends the information of the SMTP computer       back to the gmail address we want   
  
You can take this job further.
For example, you can activate the microphone while the calculator is running and save what the victim says in a file. And you can send this file to the gmail address of your choice
